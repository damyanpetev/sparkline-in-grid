Launch the demos in JSFiddle:

[Sparkline + Hierarchical Grid with Ignite UI 13.1](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jquery/1.7.2/dependencies/ui/damyanpetev/sparkline-in-grid/tree/master/13.1/ "Sparkline + Hierarchical Grid with Ignite UI 13.1")


These demos demostrate how you can use Ignite UI Sparkline charts in the Hierarchical jQuery Grid along with Responsive and Tooltips features enabled. The chart's built-in tooltips are replaced with the Popovers used by the grid that are more touch-friendly. This way the app makes the best of the space it has initially, while still providing range information with through the tooltips and in-depth data by expanding the child layouts. And the best part is the sparkline can help you go through the rows and spot outliers super fast!
